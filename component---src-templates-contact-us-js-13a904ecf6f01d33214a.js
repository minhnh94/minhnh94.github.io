"To the moon" is a title of the RPG that tells a beautiful story about the adventure of two doctors trying to help the soon-to-be-deceased people have their last wish fulfilled in their dream. It is literally a "game", but actually a movie, with the plot gently developed, doesn\'t feel rushed, heart-touching, and has a satisfying ending.
